# Maze Intro
Creates a randomized maze with Depth-first search algorithm. Then uses the A* algorithm to solve the maze. Currently not using JS modules so the program can run without a server. Just open index.html in a browser that supports canvas and ES6(2015) ei: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

- Open up some walls in the map that is over a given size, to enable more options for solving.
- Refactor to asynchronous programming.
- Expand the A* algorithm in to a better AI, by checking if the path will be intercepted.
